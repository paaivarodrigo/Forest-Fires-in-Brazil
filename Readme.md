# Forest Fires in Brazil
What is forest fire? It is the propagation of fire, in forest and savanna areas (cerrados and caatingas), normally occurs with frequency and intensity in the dry periods and is intrinsically related to the reduction of environmental humidity.

At the end of April this year, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, better known by the acronym IBAMA, published the public notice for a temporary forest fire brigade public contest. It aroused a curiosity to know more about forest fires in recent years. I started researching and found a very interesting and enriching case on the Data Viking channel (YouTube). The analysis was done with data from 1998-2017. The managerial result of the analysis is shown in the following image.

From the analysis, I could observe that:
- 2003 was the record year for forest fires;
- The months of July, August, October, November are the most worrying months because they have a median of fires much higher than the others. This explains why the public notice is in April and not before or after.
- The states of Mato Grosso, Paraíba, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia have more than 40k fires.
- The states of Mato Grosso, Rio de Janeiro and Paraíba are experiencing a new boom in forest fires.
- The state of Mato Grosso has a fire record, with almost 100k forest fires in the analyzed period.
- As we are in 2022, and we do not have the data between 2017-2022, we cannot say that most of the vacancies in the public notice are for the states mentioned above, but historically, in an analysis of 19 years, it would be plausible and current that the majority of vacancies went to the most affected states.
